## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security vulnerability in SecSuite, please report it privately to our security team so we can investigate and coordinate a fix before public disclosure.

Preferred reporting methods:

- Email: deleterious420@gmail.com
- GitHub: Open a private security advisory in this repository

When reporting, please include:

- A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (proof-of-concept) or a small test case.
- Impact assessment (what could an attacker do).
- Any mitigations you've tried or temporary workarounds.
- Your contact information for follow-up.

We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and provide a status update within 7 calendar days. If the report requires more time, we'll provide periodic updates until resolved.

## Disclosure and Fix Process

- Triage: We'll verify the report and determine severity.
- Fix: We'll create a fix branch and include tests where appropriate.
- Coordinated Disclosure: We'll work with you to coordinate a disclosure timeline and release a patched version.
- Public Advisory: After release, we'll publish details of the vulnerability and the fix in a public advisory.

## Policy on Public Disclosure

We ask that reporters do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until a fix is released or we agree on a disclosure timeline.

If you believe the vulnerability is being actively exploited or poses an immediate threat, indicate this in your report and we will prioritize accordingly.

## Thank you

Thank you for helping us keep SecSuite secure. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters who request acknowledgment.
